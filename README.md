# PMFuzz

PMFuzz is a testcase generation tool to generate high-value tests cases for PM testing tools (XFDetector, PMDebugger, PMTest and Pmemcheck)

## Dependencies
PMFuzz was tested using the following environment configuration, other versions may work:  
1. Ubuntu 18.04
2. NDCTL v64 or higher
3. libunwind (`libunwind-dev`)
4. libini-config (`libini-config-dev`)
5. Python 3.8
6. GNUMake >= 3.82
7. Kernel version 5.4
8. Anaconda or virtualenv (recommended)

For compiling documentation:  
1. doxygen
2. pdflatex
3. doxypypy

## Compiling PMFuzz

Build PMFuzz and AFL
```
make -j $(nproc --all)
```

Install PMFuzz
```
sudo make install
```

Now, pmfuzz-fuzz should be available as an executable:
```
pmfuzz-fuzz --help
```

The following man pages are also installed:
```
man 1 pmfuzz-fuzz
man 7 libpmfuzz
man 7 libfakepmfuzz
```

To uninstall PMFuzz, run the following command:
```
sudo make uninstall
```

## Compiling PMFuzz Docker image
PMFuzz also comes with a docker file to automatically configure and install pmfuzz. To build the image, run the following command from the root of the repository:
```shell
docker build -t pmfuzz-v0.9 .
```

The raw dockerfile is also available here: [/Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

## Using PMFuzz
After installing PMFuzz, use annotations by including the PMFuzz
header file:

```c
#include "pmfuzz/pmfuzz.h"

int main() {
	printf("PMFuzz version: %s\n", pmfuzz_version_str);
}
```

The program would then have to be linked with either libpmfuzz or
libfakepmfuzz. e.g.,

```makefile
example: example.o
	$(CXX) -o $@ $< -lfakepmfuzz # or -lpmfuzz
```

To compile a program linked with `libpmfuzz`, you'd need to use
PMFuzz's AFL++ version of gcc/clang. Check `build/bin` after building PMFuzz.

For debugging, `libfakepmfuzz` exports the
same interface but no actual tracking mechanism, allowing it to
compile with any C/C++ compiler.

An example program is available in [src/example](src/example). The
original ASPLOS 2021 artifact is available at
[https://github.com/Systems-ShiftLab/pmfuzz_asplos21_ae](pmfuzz_asplos21_ae).

`libpmfuzz` API is available at [docs/libpmfuzz.7.md](docs/libpmfuzz.7.md)


## Compiling Documentation
Run `make docs` from the root, and all the documentation will be
linked in the `docs/` directory.

Some man pages are available as markdown formatted files:
1. [docs/libpmfuzz.7.md](docs/libpmfuzz.7.md)
2. [docs/pmfuzz-fuzz.1.md](docs/pmfuzz-fuzz.1.md)

## Running custom configuration
PMFuzz uses a YML based configuration to set different parameters for
fuzzing, to write a custom configuration, please follow one of the
existing examples in [src/pmfuzz/configs/examples/][config_examples]
directory.

More information on PMFuzz's syntax is [here][1].

## Modifying PMFuzz
PMFuzz was written in a modular way allowing part of PMFuzz's components to be 
swapped with something that has the same interface. If you have a question
please open a new issue or a discussion.

## Other useful information
### Env variables
**NOTE**: If a variable doesn't have a possible value next to it, that variable would be enabled by setting
it to any non-empty value (including `0`).  
1. `USE_FAKE_MMAP`=(0,1): Enables fake mmap which mounts an image in the volaile memory.
2. `PMEM_MMAP_HINT`=`<addr>`: Address of the mount point of the pool.
3. `ENABLE_CNST_IMG`=(0,1): Disables default PMDK's behaviour that generates non-identical images for same input.
4. `FI_MODE`=`(<empty or unset>|IMG_GEN|IMG_REP)`: See libpmfuzz.c
5. `FAILURE_LIST`=`<path-to-output-file>`: See libpmfuzz.c
6. `PMFUZZ_DEBUG`=(0,1): Enables debug output from libpmfuzz
6. `ENABLE_PM_PATH`: Enables deep paths in PMFuzz
7. `GEN_ALL_CS`: Partially disables the probabilistic generation of crash sites and more of them are generated from `libpmfuzz.c`
8. `IMG_CREAT_FINJ`: Disables the probabilistic generation of crash sites and all of them are generated from `libpmfuzz.c`
9. `PMFUZZ_SKIP_TC_CHECK`: Disable testcase size check in AFL++
10. `PRIMITIVE_BASELINE_MODE`: Makes workload delete image on start if the pool exists

## Adding git hook for development
Following command adds a pre-commit hook to check if the tests pass:

``` shell
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/
```

## Reasons for Common errors
#### 1. FileNotFoundError for instance's pid file
Raised when AFL cannot bind to a free core or no core is free.
#### 2. Random tar command failed
Check if no free disk space is left on the device
#### 3. shmget (2): No space left on device
Run:
```
ipcrm -a
```

Warning: This removes all user owned shared memory segments, don't run
with superuser privilege or on a machine with other critical
applications running.
